== Digg Top User Tool

"The Google Cache" blog is on my RSS list and an interesting story came up recently:

http://www.thegooglecache.com/multichannel-marketing/the-tedious-but-effective-way-to-use-digg-recommended/

It details a way to make yourself known to other diggers that happen to be powerusers, thus opening
the door to get your stories dug.  It seemed pretty easy to code up and I've been playing with ruby
lately so I thought it'd be fun to solve the first half of the tedium; finding the top diggers.

This code is my very quick reply.  It uses John Wulff's digg-ruby library:

Finding this library was the best part of this little exercise.  It includes some incredible
meta-programming
